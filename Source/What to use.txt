There are 4 folders and you might get confused on what to use.
The choice must be made project by project.
To find the correct assemblies, answer these questions about each one of your VS projects.

1) Are you using WPF?

    1.1) If "Yes" (you are using WPF), are you using Windows Forms?

        1.1.1) If "Yes" (your project uses both WPF and Windows Forms), use the "Desktop" folder.

        1.1.2) If "No" (your project uses only WPF), use the "WPF" folder.
        
    1.2) If "No" (you are NOT using WPF), are you using Visual WebGUI?
    
        1.2.1) If "Yes", use the "WebGUI" folder.

        1.1.2) If "No", use the "WinForms" folder.

That's it.

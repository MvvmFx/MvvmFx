			The syntax for specifying a property is similar to that of C#. For example, a target path of "PropertyName" will attempt to
			resolve a property called "PropertyName" on the target object. A target path of "Parent.Child" will attempt first to resolve
			a property called "Parent" on the target object, and then a property called "Child" on the value of the "Parent" property.
